# 💸SpendTrillionsSimulator (Also My first Webdev Project)
 
## Project Description
This is an interactive web app that simulates spending 10 Trillion Dollars. Users start with a huge balance and can “buy” various items — from luxury cars and private jets to islands. Every purchase decreases the balance and is tracked in a purchase history. The app is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** .

## Tech Stack
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage
- **CSS animations** and responsive design for better UX
